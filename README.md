# JobFinderAPI

A simple API to publish and search for jobs.

## Installation

```
Build the image from the Dockerfile
Run the docker-compose file.
PostgreSQL is built on the fly with Docker.
```

Tests are still not self-containered, so you need run a postgres instance on your machine.

The plan is to use test-container to run the tests.
